## Sports Match Analytics Dashboard: Cricket Edition

### Introduction
Welcome to the Sports Match Analytics Dashboard project, specifically tailored for cricket. This project leverages MySQL to store, manage, and analyze cricket match data, providing valuable insights into team performance, player statistics, and trends over multiple seasons. By utilizing this repository, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of database design, complex SQL query writing, and data analysis techniques within the context of cricket.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust MySQL database that can effectively store and manage detailed cricket match data. Through a series of complex SQL queries, the project aims to extract meaningful insights, such as match outcomes, top-performing players, and team performance trends over various seasons. This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to:

1. Design normalized and efficient databases.
2. Develop intricate SQL queries for deep data analysis.
3. Provide actionable insights based on cricket match data.

### Database Design
To start, I designed a normalized database schema consisting of the following tables:

Teams: Stores information about the teams.
Players: Contains data about the players and their associated teams.
Matches: Records details of each match, including participating teams, match outcomes, and key statistics.
Statistics: Captures performance metrics for players in each match.

### SQL File Breakdown
I structured the SQL files to create and populate the tables, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the SQL scripts used in the project:

data_explore.sql: Initial exploration and setup scripts for the database.
teams.sql: Script to create and populate the "teams" table.
players.sql: Script to create and populate the "players" table.
matches.sql: Script to create and populate the "matches" table.
statistics.sql: Script to create and populate the "statistics" table.
xtract_info.sql: Queries to extract and analyze data from the database.

### Conclusion
The Cricket Match Analytics Dashboard project showcases my expertise in database management and data analysis using MySQL. By examining detailed cricket match data, this project highlights the potential for data-driven decision-making in sports. Whether you're a cricket enthusiast, a data analyst, or a developer, this repository offers valuable insights and tools for exploring cricket match analytics. Feel free to explore the SQL files, run the queries, and gain a deeper understanding of cricket data analysis.
